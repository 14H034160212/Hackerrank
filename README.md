# Hackerrank
Here are some great questions from the Hackerrank

## Highest Value Palindrome
My question is when chars[i] != chars[j], and then changeBoth - 1 >= 0. But when chars[i] == chars[j], and then changeBoth - 2 >= 0?

## Sherlock and Anagrams
This question can be divided into two steps.
### Step 1
Traverse the entire string, increasing and dividing in steps according to the step size of the substring like 1, 2, 3, ... string.length().
### Step 2
write a method to calculate whether two strings belong to Anagram.
both char array and HashMap can be used.
